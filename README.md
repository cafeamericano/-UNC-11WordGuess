### About
This application is a word guess game that utilizes NodeJS. Users may guess characters in order to determine the secret word. If the user guesses 5 letters incorrectly, the game is over. If the user uncovers the entire word before selecting 5 incorrect letters, the user wins the game. Users have the option to restart the game at the end of every session.
